# Introduction
This page is designed to teach people how to install and play PSX mods, assuming you already followed all the [setup](../README.md#setup) process. The next pages will describe how to set up your environment for developing.

## Basic usage
Go to your desired mod folder, double click `MOD.BAT`. This invokes the main python application which is responsible for automating all the process. This project comes with 3 simple mods as examples, two for the game Crash Team Racing (cross-version mods) and one for the NTSC-U release of Spyro 2: Ripto's Rage.

## Folder structure
This project uses a specific folder structure in order to look for components during execution. You must follow this structure in order to use this toolchain.

## Compiling
In order to play a mod, the first thing you need to do is hit the compiler button.

The tool will look for the `buildList.txt`, which contains a declaration of what files to compile and how to compile them. During the compilation process, several files will be created. The `output/` folder will contain `.bin` files which corresponds to the code that you compiled. The `debug/` folder contains useful debugging information, such as linker map files and `.elf` files. The `backup/` folder will contain saved information for uninstalling mods which you hot-reloaded.

## Extracting & Building an ISO
Place your iso in the `games/game_name/build/` folder, rename your iso to match the same name as the iso specified in `games/game_name/config.json`, then run the `Extract ISO` or `Build ISO` command.

Note: during the building process, all new files will be renamed to upper case files.

## Hot Reloading
Edit the file `games/settings.json` with your redux port and/or NoPS comport, then run any of the hot reload commands during the game. This will stop the game, inject mod code or patch disc files, and then resume the game running the newly injected code/patched files.

Note: for code hot reloads only, you can uninstall a mod if you select the backup option during the hot reload.
Note/NoPS: you may need to launch your game via unirom in debug mode in order to hot-reload code in your PSX.

## Texture Replacement
Edit the file `games/settings.json` with your redux port, place your images in the folder `newtex` as specified in [notes](4_notes.md), and then run the texture replacement command. This command will convert your image to the RGB5551 format, and then inject in the specified VRAM address.

## Clean Commands
* `Clean`: cleans all the files generated during the compilation process, as well as the output of texture replacement.
* `Clean Build`: cleans all the files generated during the iso building process, except the iso extraction files.
* `Clean Precompiled Header`: cleans the compiled include header file.
* `Clean All`: runs `Clean`, `Clean Build`, and `Clean Precompiled Header`, and also cleans all the files created in the iso extraction process.
